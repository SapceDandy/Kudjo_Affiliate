## Deployment Instructions

### Option 1: Vercel Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy from project root**
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard**
   - Copy all variables from `.env.example`
   - Set production Firebase config
   - Configure Sentry DSN

### Option 2: Firebase Hosting

1. **Build and deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:firebase
   ```

2. **Configure custom domain** (optional)
   ```bash
   firebase hosting:channel:deploy production --expires 30d
   ```

## Environment Variables

```

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Error Tracking
- **Sentry Dashboard**: Monitor errors, performance, and user feedback
- **Custom Alerts**: Set up alerts for error rates > 1%, API response times > 1s
- **Release Tracking**: Tag deployments to track regressions

### Performance Monitoring
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- **API Response Times**: < 1 second for all endpoints
- **Bundle Size**: Monitor JavaScript bundle size < 2MB
- **Memory Usage**: Track client-side memory consumption

### Database Maintenance
- **Index Optimization**: Monitor query performance and add indexes as needed
- **Data Cleanup**: Regular cleanup of expired coupons and old conversations
- **Backup Strategy**: Firebase automatic backups enabled

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- Admin access protected by JWT tokens with 12-hour expiration
- Firebase ID tokens used for business/influencer authentication
- Role-based access control enforced at API and database levels

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- PII handling compliant with privacy regulations
- Firestore security rules prevent unauthorized access

### API Security
- Rate limiting on public endpoints
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- CORS policies configured for production domains
- Security headers implemented (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **"Unexpected token '<'" JSON parsing errors**
   - **Cause**: API routes returning HTML error pages instead of JSON
   - **Solution**: Check authentication and error handling in API routes

2. **Firebase permission errors**
   - **Cause**: Insufficient Firestore security rules or expired tokens
   - **Solution**: Verify security rules and token refresh logic

3. **Slow page loading**
   - **Cause**: Large bundle size or inefficient data fetching
   - **Solution**: Implement code splitting and optimize queries

4. **Memory leaks**
   - **Cause**: Uncleanup event listeners or Firestore subscriptions
   - **Solution**: Ensure proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

### Debug Mode
Set `NODE_ENV=development` to enable:
- Detailed error messages
- Console logging
- Development-only debugging features
