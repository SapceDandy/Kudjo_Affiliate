- ✅ Redemption audit with search filters
- ✅ System settings: ToS version management
- ✅ Blacklist management: IP address blocking

#### API Integration Tests (`tests/integration/api-auth.test.ts`)

- ✅ Protected routes reject wrong-role requests (403)
- ✅ Offer creation validates schema and businessId binding
- ✅ Query-based filtering with pagination cursors
- ✅ Affiliate link creation with unique token generation
- ✅ Coupon redemption validation and atomic updates

#### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/core-functions.test.ts`)
- ✅ Tier mapping: Follower count thresholds → Small/Medium/Large/XL/Huge
- ✅ Affiliate token generator: URL-safe unique tokens
- ✅ Offer validators: Tier splits, date windows, max influencers
- ✅ Fraud rules: Velocity limits, geofence distance calculation
- ✅ Adapter selection: Provider string → correct adapter with fallback

#### Performance Tests (`tests/load/performance.test.ts`)
- ✅ Offer discovery query returns results under 300ms
- ✅ Concurrent coupon claims: Only one issued per user
- ✅ Concurrent offer publishes: Idempotent adapter calls
- ✅ Dashboard loads under 2s with cached aggregates

### 3. Test Data & Utilities

#### Comprehensive Seed Data (`scripts/seed-test.ts`)
- **Users**: 1 admin, 2 businesses (manual/Square POS), 2 influencers (Small/Medium tier)
- **Businesses**: Manual POS Restaurant, Square POS Cafe with proper configurations
- **Influencers**: Different tier levels with social media data
- **Offers**: 2 active campaigns with tier splits and targeting
- **Affiliate Links**: Tracking links with click/conversion data
- **Coupons**: Content meal coupons with QR codes and expiration
- **Redemptions**: Sample transaction records with earnings
- **Payouts**: Pending payout requests for testing

#### Authentication Helpers (`tests/helpers/auth.ts`)
```typescript
await loginAs(page, 'admin');
await loginAsBusiness(page);
await loginAsInfluencer(page);
await signOut(page);
```

### 4. Utility Functions Created

#### Core Functions (`apps/web/lib/utils/index.ts`)
- `tierMapping(followerCount)`: Maps followers to tier levels
- `generateAffiliateToken()`: Creates URL-safe unique tokens
- `validateOffer(offer)`: Validates tier splits, dates, limits
- `checkFraudRules(params)`: Velocity and fraud detection
- `calculateDistance(lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2)`: Geofence calculations

#### POS Adapters (`apps/web/lib/pos-adapters/index.ts`)
- Manual, Square, Clover, Toast adapter implementations
- Consistent interface: `createPromotion`, `disablePromotion`, `getPromotionStatus`
- Fallback to manual adapter for unknown providers

## 🚀 Execution Instructions

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install --save-dev @playwright/test playwright @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Run complete test suite
node test-runner.js
```

### Manual Execution
```bash
# 1. Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start --only auth,firestore,functions

# 2. Seed test data
npm run seed:test

# 3. Run tests by type
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e

# 4. View Playwright report
npx playwright show-report
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on push/PR
- **Artifacts**: Test videos, screenshots, traces uploaded
- **Coverage**: Jest coverage reports generated

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Next Steps

### TypeScript Compilation Errors
- 63 TypeScript errors need resolution before full test execution
- Errors primarily in: analytics, POS adapters, services, middleware
- Missing dependencies: `squareup`, `clsx`, `tailwind-merge`

### Required Actions Before Testing
1. **Fix TypeScript errors**:
   ```bash
   npm run typecheck
   # Address compilation errors in reported files
   ```

2. **Install missing dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install clsx tailwind-merge squareup
   ```

3. **Create environment configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Create .env.test with required variables
   NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=test-secret
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=test-client-id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=test-client-secret
   ```

### Test Execution Priority
1. **Unit Tests**: Can run independently once utils are fixed
2. **Integration Tests**: Require emulator + TypeScript fixes
3. **E2E Tests**: Require full app compilation + web server
